	<h2><em><b>All About Me!</b></em></h2>

<article>
	<p>I am a 17 year veteran teacher.  I have taught multiple facets of the 9-12 social studies curriculum over my career. For most of my career, I have focused on teaching American History. Currently, I am teaching at a small charter school in western North Carolina.  I hope to be able to design online instruction for universities and colleges, once I graduate from NC State University.  When planning for classes, I like to use a variety of software and ed tech tools to enhance the quality of my lessons.  I have found that these tools help to make the student's experiences in the classroom more engaing and enjoyable.  Some of my favorite ed tech tools include:
	<ul>
		<li>Padlet</li>
		<li>Flipgrid</li>
		<li>Powtoon</li>
		<li>WeVideo</li>
		<li>Kami</li>
		<li>Google Drawing</li>
		<li>Newsela</li>
		<li>Screencastify</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities when I am not teaching.  I read legal thrillers by John Grisham, Greg Iles, Tess Gerritsen and others.  I enjoying cooking and baking, having perfected an "Old Fashion" pound cake recipe.  Lastly, I like to travel.  My goal is to visit at least one historical site every summer!
