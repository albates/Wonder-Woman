		<h2><strong>The Origins</strong></h2>
			<p class="text-black">For decades, lovers of comic book heroes have marveled at Wonder Woman's beauty, mysticism, and strength.  William Moulton Marston's iconic female character has been a hero to young women who envisioned a life of achievement that supersedes a male dominated world.  Woman Woman made her comic book debut as a back-up character in 1941.  However, she quickly earned her own cover in the debut issue of "Sensation Comics" in January 1942.  She became a symbolic challenge to established gender roles as a role model of courage and confidence for young women. </p>
			<p>Marston was a known advocate for women's rights and openly supported the suffragist movement in the early 1900's.  He believed that women would eventually become leaders and rulers in the United States. This matriarchal idea challenged the established patriarchy of the early to mid 1900's Marston received criticisms for his character scadly clothed character.  In March 1942, the National Organization for Decent Literature black listed Wonder Woman publications for not being "sufficiently dressed". Also, Wonder Woman appeared chained up in many story lines. Marston was a supporter of women's rights activists, such as Margaret Sanger. According to author Jill Leporse, the chains reflect Marston's admiration for Sanger who used chains as a symbolism of the patriarchy that was dominating America.</p>

		<h2><strong>Wonder Woman Today</strong></h2>
		<p class="text-black"> Wonder Woman has evolved since her creation ans a comic book superhero. From 1975 to 1979, Lynda Carter portrayed Wonder Woman in a television movie on ABC.  Lyle Waggoner played the American WWII fighter pilot, Steve Trevor. Steve Trevor remains Wonder Woman's alter ego, Diana Prince,  love interest through out the series and into the recent blockbuster movies.  CBS took over the series in season 2 and renamed the show "The New Adventures of Wonder Woman" and moved the plot line to modern day.</p>
		<p>Throughout the comic books, TV show and movies she remained dependent on her sources of power including her belt, bracelets and lasso of truth.  Also, she would continue to fly her invisible plane until it was replaced an invisible jet aircraft in Season 2 of the TV series.  While Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman series had a no-kill policy with regards to characters, season 2 has Carter's Wonder Woman destroying a clone of Adolf Hitler. CBS would drop the Wonder Woman series after season 3 in an attempt to strengthen the channels sitcom offerings.</p>
		<p>Since 2017, Gal Gadot has reprised the role of Wonder Woman in three big screen movies.  With the help of director Patty Jenkins, Galdot has brought the examples of strength and courage to a new generation of young women and girls!</p>
